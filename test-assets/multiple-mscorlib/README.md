# Multiple mscorlib repro

This source is for a repro to generate an assembly with multiple mscorlib references. This requires VS 2013 to compile in such a way that the assembly
will be referencing both mscorlib v4.0.0.0 and v2.0.5.0. A compiled binary is included under the test directory which is used for tests. This solution
is only here in case the repro needs to be regenerated.
